# Project Documentation Index

This repository's canonical documentation is consolidated under the `docs/` folder.

- **Deployment:** `docs/deploy/` — deployment guides and checklists
- **Strategy & Product:** `docs/strategy/` — roadmap, quick-start, visual summary
- **Maintenance:** `docs/maintenance/` — quick fixes, troubleshooting notes
- **Architecture:** `docs/architecture/` — architecture overview and diagrams
- **Archive:** `docs/archive/` — archived notes and plans

To get started, open the folder that matches your goal (deploy, strategy, maintenance, architecture).

If you find a file that used to be in the top-level docs but is missing, check the archive first:

- `docs/archive/2025-12-09-removed/` — files archived on 2025-12-09 during repository cleanup.

If you want any archived file restored, reply here and I will restore it.
**Documentation Index**

This index links the main documentation moved from the repository root into organized `docs/` subfolders.

- **Architecture**: `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/architecture/DIAGRAMS.md`, `docs/architecture/SHARED_CODE_FLOW_MAP.md`
- **Deployment & DevOps**: `docs/deploy/DEPLOYMENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`, `docs/deploy/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- **Strategy & Product**: `docs/strategy/STRATEGY_AT_A_GLANCE.md`
- **Maintenance**: `docs/maintenance/DUPLICATE_PUMP_NOZZLE_FIX.md`

If a doc is missing here, search the repository root for a short pointer note that indicates the new `docs/` location.

Maintainers: I can continue moving the remaining root-level markdown files into `docs/` and expand this index. Would you like me to proceed?
