## 🎯 What This Solves

### ✅ Keep Costs Down
- **Current**: Possible to scale to $50/month
- **Strategy**: Start at $0, grow to $5-10/month slowly
- **Benefit**: Cost scales with users (~$0.10 per user)

### ✅ Preserve Test User Data
- **Problem**: If you reset dev DB, test data is lost
- **Solution**: Three separate databases
- **Benefit**: Test data in testing DB never affected by dev work

### ✅ Continuous Development
- **Problem**: Can't develop while testing in production
- **Solution**: Three environments operate independently
- **Benefit**: Dev continues 24/7, never blocked

### ✅ Multi-Platform Ready
- **Web**: Already working
- **Mobile**: React Native (iOS & Android) - Month 2
- **Desktop**: Tauri Windows app - Month 3
- **Benefit**: Same backend, 80% shared code, minimal overhead
