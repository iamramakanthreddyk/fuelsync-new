## 🎯 Most Important Things To Remember

### 1. Start Small
Don't try to do everything at once. Focus on Week 1 checklist.

### 2. Separate Environments
- Dev: Break things, test locally
- Test: Share with test users
- Prod: Real users, never touch

### 3. Preserve Test Data
Each environment has its own database. Test data stays in testing!

### 4. Follow The Checklist
QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md has everything you need this week.

### 5. One Platform At A Time
- Month 1: Get web working smoothly
- Month 2: Add mobile
- Month 3: Add desktop
- Don't rush
